## Finished
### Accelerate: The Science of Lean Software and DevOps by Nicole Forsgren PhD, Jez Humble, and Gene Kim

Accelerate is a data-driven analyses of the effects of DevOps and Lean software development culture on technology companies.

What drew me to this book:
- it's data-driven approach to analyzing software team performance after adopting lean and DevOps cultures. 
- a foreword by Martin Fowler 
- Co-authored by Gene Kim, a co-author of the software development team management bible "The Phoenix Project"

What I thought of it:

- VERY DRY. It's data-driven approach was appreciated. Not laugh-a-minute
- great breakdowns of key concepts in the form of graphs and pictures
- Absolutely excellent. The research methodology is sound and it's great to have something I can point to and say: "This is what helps, this is what proves it."
- ...Could have cut out the parts justifying the research methodology and just given me the facts, and provided a companion website to justify the research

Key quotes

```
Fundamentally, most deployment problems are caused by a complex, brittle deployment process. This is typically the result of three factors. First, software is often not written with deployability in mind. A common symptom here is when complex, orchestrated deployments are required because the software expects its environment and dependencies to be set up in a very particular way and does not tolerate any kind of deviation from these expectations, giving little useful information to administrators on what is wrong and why it is failing to operate correctly."
```

```
As in other fast-paced, high consequence work, software and technology are plagued by employee burnout. Technology managers, like so many other well-meaning managers, often try to fix the person while ignoring the work environment, even though changing the environment is far more vital for long-term success. Managers who want to avert employee burnout should concentrate their attention and efforts on:

- Fostering a respectful, supportive work environment that emphasizes learning from failures rather than blaming
- Communicating a strong sense of purpose
- Investing in employee development
- Asking employees what is preventing them from achieving their objectives and then fixing those things
- Giving employees time, space, and resources to experiment and learn.

Last but not least, employees must be given the authority to make decisions that affect their work and their jobs, particularly in areas where they are responsible for the outcomes.
```

```
Six factors that lead to burnout:

1. Work overload: job demands exceed human limits
2. Lack of control: inability to influence decisions that affect your job
3. Insufficient rewards: insufficient financial, institutional, or social rewards
4. Breakdown of community: unsupportive workplace environment
5. An absence of fairness: lack of fairness in decision making process
value conflicts: Mismatch in organizational values and the individual's values

### The Tattoo History Source Book by Steve Gilbert

What drew me to this book:

- I like tattoos
- I wanted to know more about the history of tattoos

What I thought of it:

- Really informative and excellent
- AWESOME photos
- Could not help but wish it was more narrative, instead of a sourcebook with a lot of secondary sources. Not all of that writing aged particularly well.

What I thought of it:

### A Theory of Fun for Game Design by Raph Koster

### Blood, Sweat, and Pixels by Jason Schreier

What drew me to this book:
- it was a gift

What I thought of it:
- I thought it was great
- A TON of parallels between game development and normal software development
- Made the last 10 years of video game releases make a lot more sense...
  - Dragon Age Inquisition was terrible and this game describes why. I ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT GAME SUCKED!!
- Software quality in "Stardew Valley." Software quality is never a problem... until it is
  - I HAVE SEEN THIS EXACT THING BEFORE!!
  - Unit tests would have prevented this.
  - `Barone had to spend all of his free time zapping the bugs that kept popping up. "It would be right as we were trying to go to sleep," said Hageman," and he'd be freaking out like, 'Ok, I just have to stay up and fix this,' and he'd be up the whole night"`
  - `It becomes a vicious cycle. Fans would submit bugs, and Barone would release patches to fix those bugs. Only to inadvertently trigger more bugs. Then he'd pull all-nighters trying to fix the new ones. This pattern went on for weeks. " I think success like that on your hands can be quite a shock," said Chucklefish's Finn Brice. "Suddenly, you feel as if you owe a lot of people a lot of things."`
  
  
- "The thing that makes scheduling challenging is iteration," said Rob Foote. "You have to allow for iteration if you want to make a great product." Iteration time was the last one percent..."
- Markus believed the best way to make a video game was to spend as much time as possible in preproduction, which meant lots of talking, prototyping, and answering questions both big and small.

### Gang Leader for a Day by Sudhir Venkatesh

What drew me to this book:
- A recommendation from SOMEONE at some point

What did I think of it:

- Great read.
- Tragic. Heartbreaking. Makes you want to learn more.

- Recently I decided to start back from zero, and re-read all of the books I've ever read
- Always a huge fan of this book

What I thought:

- That this book is powerful. Heartbreaking. That I cried multiple times while reading it.
- Vonnegut's wit and humanity and love are still present throughout the book.

### The Urth of the New Sun by Gene Wolfe
What drew me to this book:

- I am a fan of the Dark Souls series of video games, which draw their inspiration from this book series.
- My group of friends and I have been reading it. Cackling at the poorly aged tropes and secretly being drawn into Gene Wolfe's strange, broken reality.
- I read the first 4.

What I thought:

- Dumb and crazy which is exactly what I want
- Not quite as nuts as the other books

## Attempted

### Starting Strength by Mark Rippetoe

- I am starting strength training. This book is often recommended.

What I thought:
- Good lord. This book is DRY and TECHNICAL and LONG. 
- I want a practical guide to weight lifting. This reads like an anatomy textbook.
